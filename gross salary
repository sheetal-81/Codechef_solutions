Problem
In a company an emplopyee is paid as under: If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of base salary and DA = 90% of basic salary.
If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. 
If the Employee's salary is input, write a program to find his gross salary.
NOTE: Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + DA
Input
