Problem
Janmansh and Jay are playing a game. They start with a number X and they play a total of Y moves.
Janmansh plays the first move of the game, after which both the players make moves alternatingly.
In one move, a player can increment or decrement X by 1.
If the final number after performing 
Y moves is even, then Janmansh wins otherwise, Jay wins. Determine the winner of the game if both the players play optimally.
