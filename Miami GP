Miami GP
Problem
Chef has finally got the chance of his lifetime to drive in the F1 tournament.
But, there is one problem. Chef did not know about the 107% rule and now he is worried whether he will be allowed to race in the main event or not.
Given the fastest finish time as X seconds and Chef's finish time as Y seconds,
determine whether Chef will be allowed to race in the main event or not.
Note that, Chef will only be allowed to race if his finish time is within 107% of the fastest finish time.
