Problem
In discus throw, a player is given 3 throws and the throw with the longest distance is regarded as their final score.
You are given the distances for all 3 throws of a player. Determine the final score of the player.

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, three integers ,A,B, and C denoting the distances in each throw.
Output Format
For each test case, output the final score of the player.
Explanation

Test Case 1: 
The longest distance is achieved in the second throw, which is equal to 15 units. Thus, the answer is 15.

Test Case 2:
In all throws, the distance is 32 units. Thus, the final score is 32.

Test Case 3: The longest distance is achieved in the first throw which is equal to 82 units.
Thus, the answer is 82.
