Problem
There is a group of N friends who wish to enroll in a course together. 
The course has a maximum capacity of M students that can register for it. 
If there are K other students who have already enrolled in the course, determine if it will still be possible for all the N friends to do so or not.

		    int N=sc.nextInt();     //wish to enroll
		    int M=sc.nextInt();     //maximum capacity
		    int K=sc.nextInt();     //already enrolled
		    int result=N+K;
