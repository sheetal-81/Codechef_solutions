Credit score

Problem
To access CRED programs, one needs to have a credit score of 750 or more.
Given that the present credit score is X, determine if one can access CRED programs or not.
If it is possible to access CRED programs, output YES, otherwise output NO.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains a single integer X, the credit score.


/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		    int x=sc.nextInt();
		    if(x>=750){
		        System.out.println("YES");
		    }else{
		        System.out.println("NO");
		    }
		// your code goes here
	}
}
