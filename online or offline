Problem
Chef is confused whether to go out and eat at the restaurant or order food online.
The online order costs N rupees while the cost of eating at the restaurant is M rupees.
However, Chef has a discount coupon with which he can avail flat 10% off on his online order.
Find the cheaper option for Chef to eat, i.e., whether to order food online or eat at the restaurant.

Explanation:
Test case 1: The final price of ordering online would be 500−(10% of 500)=450 which is less than the price of dining.
Thus, Chef should order online.

Test case 2: The final price of ordering online would be 500−(10% of 500)=450 which is not less than 400. 
Thus, Chef should choose dining option.

Test case 3: Even after the 10% discount, cost of ordering online is higher.
Thus, Chef should choose dining option.

Test case 4: After 10% discount, cost of ordering online is 90.
The costs of ordering online and dining at restaurant are same. Thus, Chef can choose any option.
