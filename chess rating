Problem
Alice has recently started playing Chess. Her current rating is X.
She noticed that when she wins a game, her rating increases by 8 points.

Can you help Alice in finding out the minimum number of games she needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to Y?

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt();

        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
            int a = sc.nextInt();
            int b = sc.nextInt();
            int count=0;
            while(a<b){
                a=a+8;
                count++;
            }
            System.out.println(count);
        }
    }
}
