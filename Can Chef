Problem
Chef owns a car that can run 15 kilometers using 
1 liter of petrol.
He wants to attend a programming camp at DAIICT.
X liters of petrol is present in Chef's car. The distance between his house and DAIICT is Y kilometers.
Determine whether Chef can attend the event and return to his home with the given amount of petrol.
Note: Chef has to return back to home, so the total distance to be covered would be 2â‹…Y.
Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef needs to cover a distance of 100 kilometers in total. He can cover it with 10 liters of petrol.
Test case 2: Chef needs to cover a distance of 400 kilometers in total but using 15 liters of petrol, he can cover only 225 kilometers.
Test case 3: Chef needs to cover a distance of 40 kilometers in total. He can cover it with 3 liters of petrol.
