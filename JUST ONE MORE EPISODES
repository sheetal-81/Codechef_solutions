Problem

Chef has to attend an exam that starts in 
X minutes, but of course, watching shows takes priority.
Every episode of the show that Chef is watching, is 24 minutes long.
If he starts watching a new episode now, will he finish watching it strictly before the exam starts?
Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer â€” YES if Chef will finish his episode before the exam starts, and NO otherwise.
Each character of the output may be printed in either lowercase or uppercase, i.e, the string Yes, YES, yes, YeS` will all be treated as equivalent.

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=sc.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<t;i++){
		    int a=sc.nextInt();
		    if(a>24){
		       System.out.println("YES");
		    }
		    else{
		        System.out.println("No");
		    }
		}// your code goes here
	}
}
