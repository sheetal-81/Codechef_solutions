Problem
Chef has N friends. Chef promised that he would gift a pair of shoes (consisting of one left shoe and one right shoe) to each of his 
N friends. Chef was about to go to the marketplace to buy shoes, but he suddenly remembers that he already had M left shoes.
What is the minimum number of extra shoes that Chef will have to buy to ensure that he is able to gift a pair of shoes to each of his N friends?
For example, if N=2,M=4, then Chef already has 4 left shoes, so he must buy 2 extra right shoes to form 2 pairs of shoes.
Therefore Chef must buy at least 2 extra shoes to ensure that he is able to get N=2 pairs of shoes.
