Problem
Alice has recently learned in her economics class that the market is said to be in equilibrium when the supply is equal to the demand.
Alice has market data for N time points in the form of two integer arrays S and D.
Here, S i denotes the supply at theℎi th  point of time and D i denotes the demand at the ℎi th  point of time, for each 1≤i≤N.
Help Alice in finding out the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium.
