Problem
The National Championships are starting soon. There are 4 race categories, numbered from 1 to 4, that Chef is interested in.
Chef is participating in exactly 2 of these categories.
Chef has an arch-rival who is, unfortunately, the only person participating who is better than Chef, 
i.e, Chef can't defeat the arch-rival in any of the four race categories but can defeat anyone else. 
Chef's arch-rival is also participating in exactly 2 of the four categories.
Chef hopes to not fall into the same categories as that of the arch-rival.
Given X,Y,A,B where X,Y are the races that Chef participates in, and A,B are the races that Chef's arch-rival participates in, 
find the maximum number of gold medals (first place) that Chef can win.
