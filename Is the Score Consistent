Is the Score Consistent
Problem
Chef is watching a football match. 
The current score is A:B, that is, team 1 has scored A goals and team 2 has scored B goals.
Chef wonders if it is possible for the score to become C:D at a later point in the game 
(i.e. team 1 has scored C goals and team 2 has scored D goals).
Can you help Chef by answering his question?
