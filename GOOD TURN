Problem
Chef and Chefina are playing with dice. In one turn, both of them roll their dice at once.
They consider a turn to be good if the sum of the numbers on their dice is greater than 6
Given that in a particular turn Chef and Chefina got 
X and Y on their respective dice, find whether the turn was good.
input:=          4  
                1 4
                3 4
                4 2
                2 6
output:=        NO
                YES
                NO
                YES
