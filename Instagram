Instagram

Problem
Chef categorises an instagram account as spam, if, the following count of the account is more than 10 times the count of followers.
Given the following and follower count of an account as X and Y respectively, find whether it is a spam account.
Explanation:
Test case 1: 
The following count is 1 while the follower count is 10. Since the following count is not more than 10 times the follower count, the account is not spam.
Test case 2: 
The following count is 10 while the follower count is 1. Since the following count is not more than 10 times the follower count, the account is not spam.
Test case 3:
The following count is 11 while the follower count is 1. Since the following count is more than 10 times the follower count, the account is spam.
Test case 4:
The following count is 97 while the follower count is 7. Since the following count is more than 10 times the follower count, the account is spam.
